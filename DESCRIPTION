Description: The package wildlifeTG provides tools for performing time
    geographic analysis of animal tracking data. The functions provide useful
    tools for examining wildflife movement from the context of accessibility.
    The time geographic framework is an alternative view on typical home range
    estimation procedures. Currently, the package provides functions that
    faciliate the calculation of the PPA and dynPPA measures of an individual's
    accessibility space. Please note that the package is still under
    development. Please see the wildlifeTG website at
    http://jedalong.github.io/wildlifeTG for the latest information and most
    up-to-date version of the package.
